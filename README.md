# Node.js - A Brief Overview

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side. It's built on the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine and provides a powerful environment for server-side scripting.

## Key Points

- **JavaScript on the Server:** Node.js enables you to use JavaScript for server-side programming. This means you can use the same language, JavaScript, for both the client and server sides of a web application.

- **Non-Blocking and Asynchronous:** One of Node.js's main features is its non-blocking, event-driven architecture. This allows it to handle a large number of connections efficiently without waiting for one operation to finish before moving to the next.

- **NPM (Node Package Manager):** Node.js comes with a built-in package manager called NPM. It's a vast repository of open-source libraries and tools that make development faster and more efficient.

- **Scalability:** Node.js is known for its ability to handle a high volume of concurrent connections, making it suitable for building real-time applications, APIs, and microservices.

- **Community and Ecosystem:** Node.js has a vibrant community, with a vast ecosystem of packages and frameworks that simplify web development.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation:** To get started with Node.js, you'll need to [download and install it](https://nodejs.org/). This will also install NPM.

2. **Hello World:** Create a simple "Hello World" program to test your Node.js installation. Here's a basic example:

   ```javascript
   // hello.js
   console.log("Hello, Node.js!");
