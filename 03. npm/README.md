## What is npm?

- **npm (Node Package Manager)** is a package manager for JavaScript and Node.js.
- It helps developers discover, share, and use code packages and libraries.
- npm is included with Node.js, so you don't need to install it separately.

## Installing npm

- To install npm, you need to install Node.js, which comes with npm bundled.
- Download Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).
- Verify your installation by running:
  ```sh
  node -v
  npm -v
Using npm
Package.json
The package.json file is the heart of your project and defines its metadata and dependencies.
You can create one by running npm init and following the prompts.
Installing Packages
Use npm install to install packages locally in your project. For example:



Copy code
npm install package-name
The package and its version are added to your package.json file as dependencies.
Managing Dependencies
package.json lists your project's dependencies and their versions.
Use npm install without a package name to install all dependencies listed in package.json.
Scripts
You can define custom scripts in your package.json file.
Run a script using npm run script-name. For example:



Copy code
npm run start
Publishing Packages
You can publish your own packages to the npm registry.
Create an account on the npm website, then use npm login to authenticate.
Use npm publish to publish your package.
Common npm Commands
npm install: Install project dependencies.
npm update: Update dependencies to their latest versions.
npm list: List installed packages and their versions.
npm outdated: Show outdated packages.
