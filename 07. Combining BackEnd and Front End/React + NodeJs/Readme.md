## How it Works:

Your Node.js backend serves as an API, providing data when requested. In this example, it responds to a GET request to /api/message with a simple message.

The React frontend fetches data from the backend API and displays it on the webpage. The frontend's useEffect hook ensures the API call is made when the component mounts.

When you run the frontend development server, it opens your React application in a web browser, making it possible to view and interact with the frontend.

By combining React with a backend server, you have the basis for building full-stack web applications. In a real-world scenario, you'd develop more complex features, 
handle user authentication, and work with databases or other data sources on the backend.
